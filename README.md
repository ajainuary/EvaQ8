Our aim is to help people reach a safehouse in the aftermath of a disaster, from where rescue and rehabilitation operations can be carried out faster and more efficiently. This reduces the probability of people getting lost and/or starved and/or harmed by the after effects of the original disaster.
Think of this as a "dispatcher" in an emergency.

## Detecting Disaster
1. We rely on social media and news outlets to deliver the news of a disaster having occurred in a region.
2. We also monitor the appâ€™s activity in the region. We can also rely on people for giving further updates regarding availability of infrastructure and safe paths.
## Identifying Safehouses
1. We use AI to detect which subregions in a map can be safer for people to congregate awaiting official help.
2. We also keep marking people safe and alert the location of the people who have asked for help but not yet reached the safehouse to the authorities, to look for them earlier increasing the survival probability.
## Directing People
1. We utilize a completely web-based solution to get over the frustration of installing the app when in need. We can also provide a SMS based service in regions when the internet access is unavailable due to infrastructure damages.
2. People will be given clear directions to a SAFE path (not necessarily the shortest one) to the safehouse. 
3. People can also declare medical emergency on the way so that appropriate assistance can be given timely.
